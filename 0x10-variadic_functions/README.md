# Variadic Functions

This project contains C functions that work with variable numbers of arguments:

- `sum_them_all` returns the sum of all its parameters.
- `print_numbers` prints numbers with a separator.
- `print_strings` prints strings with a separator and handles NULL strings.
- `print_all` prints various data types based on a format string.

To compile and use the functions, include the appropriate header and call the functions in your code.
